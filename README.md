Burpee WAR - A Card game where the loser wins in fitness :)

This game is inspired by the conventional War Game, where there are two players, one full deck of cards and chances to win or lose, depending on who got the highest card on top of their covered deck. 

With our Burpee War version of the game, our goal is to create a fun and interactive way to challenge players to improve their physical strength and move throughout the day. This our favorite part of the game: The more you lose, the stronger you become! You’ll have contradicting feelings when playing this game, we get it, but that’s part of the fun!
 
 GAME RULES:
 1) You play to WIN, but we are rooting for you to loose! 
 2) Hit "RESET" to start or restart the game.
 3) Hit "PLAY" to show a new card.
 4) On each hand played, three burpees are assigned to the player with the lowest card value, zero to the player with the highest card value. 
 5) When a player reaches 15 burpees the game ENDS.
 6) Both players get to do the amount of burpees on their scoreboard (the loser will always have 15).
 
 Our recommendation:
 Play this game daily! It will help you get your body moving, become stronger and release happy hormones!

Have fun and we hope you lose!
